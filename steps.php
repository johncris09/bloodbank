                  <a><strong>EAT</strong></a>
                  <p>You should not donate on an empty stomach. Eating regularly before donating will help keep your blood sugar levels stable.
                    This is important so that you don't feel lightheaded or dizzy after your donation. Having a snack before donation can help 
                    maintain these blood sugar levels. Ensuring that your diet contains foods rich in iron - such as meats and green leafy vegetables
                   - will help to keep your feeling well during and after donation.</p><br>
                    <a><strong>DRINK</strong></a>
                    <p>Almost half of the blood taht you donate is made up of water. The fluids that you lose  during donation 
                      can cause a drop in blood pressure - causing you to feel faint and dizzy. <br> To help prevent this from happening we 
                      ask you to drink 500ml of water immediately before you give blood - we'll give this to you before you donate.
                      It's also important to ensure that you are well hydrated in the days leading up to your donation.
                      This will help <br> to compensate for the fluids lost during donation, and will help to bring your blood volume
                      levels back to normal. it is essential to avoid alcohol before and after donating as this may affect hydration levels
                      and delay recovery.</p><br>
                  <a><strong>EXERCISE</strong></a>
                  <p>Avoid doing any vigorous exercise or heavy lifting the day your donation - both before and after you've given blood.
                    Keeping your body in a rested state is important to give it a chance to replenish the fluids lost during donation
                    , which will help you avoid feeling dizzy or lightheaded and keep you well. light exercise such as walking is fine,
                    but please make sure that you are fully recovered and hydrated prior to your donation.</p><br>
                  <a><strong>WEAR</strong></a>
                  <p>We will need to roll up your sleeves past your elbow when you give blood - to allow easy acces to your veins.
                    To make sure that you are comfortable, please waer clothing with loose sleeves.</p><br>
                  <a><strong>DISTRACT</strong></a>
                  <p>It is normal to feel nervous when you come along to donate - particularly if this is your first time. Our 
                    friendly  and helpful staff will put you at ease straightaway. Distraction is a key. You may want to bring 
                    a friend to wait with you, or feel free to bring a book to read or listen to some music while you donate.
                    We also ask donors to undertake something called "applied muscle tension" or AMT. This is a simple behavioural
                    technique that helps you to maintain blood pressure, and so stops you from feeling faint or unwell. It is 
                    also a brilliant distraction technique! AMT involves tensing and relaxing the body's major muscles during the
                    donation process. A favourite of ours is clenching and unclenching your buttock muscles (no joke!). Further
                    information about this will be available at your donation , or simply ask a member of staff who will be happy
                    to advice you further.</p><br>
                  <a><strong>KNOW</strong></a>
                  <p>Once you've made the decision to donate and made the effort to go - along to your appointment, 
                    you want to be sure that you can actually give blood. Although most people can give blood, there are some
                    restrictions - depending on things like your health, medication, and whether you've been abroad recently.
                    Check who can give give blood using our interactive questions which cover the most common reasons donors 
                    are unable to donate when they attend their appointment.</p><br>
                  <a><strong>SLEEP</strong></a>
                  <p>Where recommended that you have a full night's sleep of beetwen 7 to 9 hours the night before donation.
                    This will help you to feel more alert when you give blood, which will in turn reduce the risk to feeling
                    unwell.</p><br>

                    what we are doing and answer any questions <br> you may have.</strong></p>
                  <a><strong>Welcome And Preperations<strong></a>
                  <p>Before donating blood, please eat regular meals, drink plenty of fluid (non-alcoholic) and avoid vigorous exercise 
                    or exertion. We must give you sufficient information so that you can make an informed choice on the benefits and risks
                    of donating blood and samples for testing. We will provide 500ml of fluid just before you donate. By drinking this
                    over about 5 minutes, it wil help your well being and after donation.</p>
                  <a>Health Screening</a>
                  <p>You will be called private health screening, where a donor career will confirm your identity. It's critical
                    that we guarantee an accurate link between you, your Donor Health Check and your donation. We must ensure
                    that it's safe for you to donate and your donation is safe for a patient to recieve. We'll ask some confidential 
                    questions based on your completed Donor Health Check. There is a period of time from contact with any infection
                    to detecting markers in the laboratory. We trust your honesty when answering these pesonal questions. This will 
                    ensure your blood is safe to transfuse to patients. You may be referred to a registered nurse for certain medical
                    queries: their uniforms have red piping on the nurse collar and cuffs. an explenation will always be provided if you 
                    are not able to donate. You will be advised when you can donate, and we'll encourage you to make an appointment
                    before you leave the team are only able to book future appointments for the venue they are currently. For your 
                    wellbeing, we must ensure you have enough haemoglobin(iron) in your blood before donating. A small blood 
                    sample will be taken from your finger to test your haemoglobin levels. If your test is borderline, we will
                    offer you a confirmatory test. This requires a sample of blood from your arm, to be tested in a machine at the session.
                    We will advice you of the result. Following health screening, we will be asked to sit in a different waiting area.
                    from here you'll be called and invited to a donation chair.</p><br>
